# When we are building complex programs, we need a 
# way to pass in data that is NOT always
# from the user

# Function arguments and parameters are ways to
# pass in data to a function from possibly
# another function.

# Function Parameters- this is PLACEHOLDER DATA for 
# a function. variables inside the curly brackets

# memory trick - PARAMETER AND PLACEHOLDER BOTH
# START WITH THE LETTER P
def check_Water_Depth(depth):
    print(depth)
    print(depth > 10) # true if depth is greater than 10 feet
    # return depth

# Function Arguments- This is the REAL DATA that we pass into
# the function call
# memory trick- if you make a REAL world argument with a person
# you need to come with REAL facts (data)
check_Water_Depth(3)

# return - this keyword allows us to pass data from INSIDE 1 function
# into another function
